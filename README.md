# Angular2-Getting Started
Materials for the "Angular 2: Getting Started" course on Pluralsight.

`APM - Start`: The starter files. Use this to code along with the course.

`APM - Final`: The completed files. Use this to see the completed solution from the course.

See the `README.md` file under each folder for details on installing and running the application.

If you are have any problems installing or running this code, please see the ["Angular 2: Getting Started Problem Solver"](http://blogs.msmvps.com/deborahk/angular-2-getting-started-problem-solver/)

If that does not resolve your issue, please post to the [discussion board for the course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/angular-2-getting-started/discussion)

NOTE: The sample files here have been updated to *Beta 15*. At this point in time, there is no plan to update these files to a more recent beta/rc because as of *beta 16*, there are *breaking changes* that would cause the files here to mismatch with the demos presented in the course.

We are currently discussing the appropriate time to update the course and at that time, these files will be updated.

NOTE: The installation was tested using node v5.0.0 and npm 3.3.6.
