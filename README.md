Materials for the ["Angular: Getting Started"](http://bit.ly/Angular2-GettingStarted) course on Pluralsight.

`APM - Start`: The starter files set up for use in VSCode, WebStorm, or other editors. **Use this to code along with the course**. (Updated for <i>Angular version 2 final</i>)

`APM - Final`: The completed files. Use this to see the completed solution from the course. (Updated for <i>Angular version 2 final</i>)

`APM-Start-Updated`: The starter files set up for use in VSCode, WebStorm, or other editors. (Updated for <i>Angular version 4</i>) NOTE: You can use these files to code along, but they will **NOT** match the course exactly. The folder structure and some of the boilerplate files have been changed since the recording of the course.

`APM-Final-Updated`: The completed files. (Updated for <i>Angular version 4</i>)

`APM-CLI-Start`: The starter files set up for use with the Angular CLI. NOTE: If you use these files to code along with the course they will **NOT** match the course setup files and will **NOT** match some of the hands-on exercises.

See the `README.md` file under each folder for details on installing and running the application.

If you have any problems installing or running this code, please see the ["Angular 2: Getting Started Problem Solver"](http://blogs.msmvps.com/deborahk/angular-2-getting-started-problem-solver/)
